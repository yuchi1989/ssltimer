### Title
#### SSLTimer: Testing an SSL Implementation with respect to Timing Attack Vulnerability

### Team
Yuchi Tian  

### Introduction
In this project, I will try to reproduce [Remote Timing Attacks are Practical](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/ssl-timing.pdf). This project involves an exploration of accurate timing samples collecting and analyzing. But it may be based on the assumption that the tested servers and SSLTimer are in the same LAN network since remote timing depends on the stability of network.

### Motivation
A timing attack exploits data-dependent behaviorial charactoristics of the implementation of an algorithm. Some implementions of cryptographic algorithms including RSA are vulnerable to timing attack. In these implementations, there may exist a correlation between key and the encryption time and the time information can be exploited to infer keys. The information leaked by measuring time can also be combined with other cryptanlaysis techniques to make the attack more effective. If the implementation of SSL is vulnerable to timing attack, it will cause critical security and privacy issues. There is no existing tools focuing on testing SSL implementations with respect to the timing attack vulnerability. Thus in this project I will try to design and implement a tool SSLTimer that can analyze and test if an implementation of SSL is vulnerable to timing attack on RSA decryption.   
  

### Project plan
1. Implement SSL handshake protocol to initiate a handshake with a SSL server and explore an accurate timing method using CPU cycles.  
2. Analyze if an implementation of SSL is vulnerable to the timing attack on RSA decryption.
3. Identify if the anlaysis process can be automated and complete the remaining part of this tool.
